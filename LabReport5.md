### Response from TA
Hello student, it seems that you are running your compile code in the wrong file directory. You need to be in the directory starter, instead of the overall PA8 directory. You can move into it by using the command ```cd starter```

### Reflection
I think some of the biggest takeaways from the second-half of this quarter are the bash scripts and VIM editing. I personally never knew bash scripts existed, and from what I've seen so far these can be very useful to save some time. And while I don't have the best view and knowledge to understand why VIM could be super useful, I know how powerful it can be, it is just that right now I would not really have a purpose using it.
